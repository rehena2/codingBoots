<h3><B>**<u>Most Popular Features of C Language::</u></B></h3>
<p>The core features of a programming language describe its ability and uniqueness and how beneficial it can be in developing a website or software. Listed below are some of the significant features of C language:</p>
<br>
<h3><b>**<u>Simple and Effiecient::</u></b></h3>
<p>The basic syntax style of implementing C language is very simple and easy to learn.

 This makes the language easily comprehensible and enables a programmer to redesign 

 or create a new application. C is usually used as an introductory language to 

 introduce programming to school students because of this feature.</p>
 <br>
 <h3><b>**<u>Fast::</u></b></h3>
 <p>
    It is a well-known fact that statically typed programming languages are faster than dynamic ones. C is a statically typed programming language, which gives it an edge over other dynamic languages. Also, unlike Java and Python, which are interpreter-based, C is a compiler-based program. This makes the compilation and execution of codes faster.

<br><br> Another factor that makes C fast is the availability of only the essential and required features. Newer programming languages come with numerous features, which increase functionality but reduce efficiency and speed. Since C offers limited but essential features, the headache of processing these features reduces, resulting in increased speed.
 </p>
 <h3><b>**<u>Portability</u></b></h3>
 <p>
    Another feature of the C language is portability. To put it simply, C programs
     are machine-independent which means that you can run the fraction of a code 
     created in C on various machines with none or some machine-specific changes.
      Hence, it provides the functionality of using a single code on multiple systems 
      depending on the requirement
